Usage

  Using the plugin is very easy. It has just to be called within the Maven project.

+---
mvn com.cedarsoft.rest:rest-generator-maven-plugin:generate \
  -Ddomain.class.pattern=src/main/java/com/cedarsoft/MyDomainObject.java
+---

* Shortening the command line

  Either add an entry to your

  It might be a good idea to add that entry to your <<<${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml>>>

+---
<pluginGroups>
  <pluginGroup>com.cedarsoft.rest</pluginGroup>
</pluginGroups>
+---

  Then it is possible to just call the plugin using

+---
mvn rest-generator:generate -Ddomain.class.pattern=src/main/java/com/cedarsoft/MyDomainObject.java
+---


Generation process

 This plugin analyzes the source code of the domain object source file. It then creates a serializer and corresponding unit tests using some
 simple heuristics.

* Generating JAXB Model

 This serializers are placed in <<<target/generated-sources/cedarsoft-serialization-main>>>


Defining the plugin version

  It is recommended to define the plugin version for each plugin. Therefore that section should be added to the pom.xml:

+----
<build>
  <pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.cedarsoft.rest</groupId>
        <artifactId>rest-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${currentStableVersion}</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </pluginManagement>
</build>
+----
